            <div class="text">
               <p> Fancy singing on the main stage this year?</p>

               <p> On Monday afternoon, Richard Navarro will be entrusting his extraordinary songs
                to Greenbelt festival-goers and celebrating the Common Good through the biggest choir
                Greenbelt has ever seen. <b>And you can be a part of it.</b></p>

               <p> Multi-instrumentalist Richard Navarro and his co-musician Nicholas Thurston are
                returning to Greenbelt following last year’s jaw-dropping audio-visual show in the
                Playhouse, and this time they’re upsizing with help from the biggest, brightest and
                beautiful voices around. (That’s you, that is!).</p>

              <p>  With the help of the Greenbelt team, the duo is forming a huge choir to perform
                alongside them during their main stage set on the Monday.</p>

               <p> There will be two rehearsals on site during the weekend, and the parts are arranged
                for a full four-part choir, meaning that all ages, and all types of voices can get involved.
                The band will guide you through the parts in rehearsals and provide lyrics sheets or written scores,
                so, whether you’re a seasoned soprano, a bathroom-only bass or new to singing in a group,
                you can get stuck straight into the singing.</p>

               <p> The new set of songs – entitled “Firewatching” – tells the story of some intriguing
                characters from the history of the musicians’ hometown, Canterbury. As well as being gorgeously
                folky and downright funky, this is music that celebrates the strength, courage and compassion
                of the heroes and heroines of their city’s past. Taking part will be a brilliant, exhilarating
                way to be a part of a new musical venture and meet like-minded types along the way.</p>

               <p> If you are interested in being a part of the choir for Richard Navarro’s Greenbelt show,
                please complete the form via the link on the right here.</p>

               <p> Once you have signed up, you will be given more details including directions to
                a webpage containing all the songs plus lyrics and sheet music.</p>

                <p>A couple of things to note:</p>

                    <li>
                        Although it will be possible to pick things up for the first time during the
                        rehearsals at Greenbelt, to really get the most out of the experience
                        some advance listening and preparation will be encouraged.

                        This opportunity is only open to festival-goers who are already attending
